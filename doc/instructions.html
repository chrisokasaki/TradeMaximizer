<h2><a name="requirements"/>System Requirements</h2>

<p>
TradeMaximizer is implemented in Java, and should run on any machine
with a recent Java Runtime Environment.  It has been tested using Java
SE Runtime Environment Version 6.

<h2><a name="about"/>Introduction to TradeMaximizer</h2>

<p>
TradeMaximizer supports multi-party trades in which each party offers
up items for trade, and selects items that they wish to receive. The
system then finds the largest set of items that can be traded
simultaneously.

<p>
In general, the trades found by TradeMaximizer are not two-party
swaps, where A receives an item from B, and B receives an item from A.
Instead, trades will usually be composed of one or more larger cycles,
in which each person sends an item to the previous person in the
cycle and receives an item from the next person in the cycle.

<p>
The way such trades are usually run is as follows:
<ul>
<li> One person (the <i>moderator</i>) announces the trade, and decides on
basic details such as the schedule.
<li> Participants submit information on the items they wish to offer
for trade.
<li> At some point, the trade closes to new entries, and the moderator publishes an official list of item names.
<li> Partipants review the offered items, and construct <a href="#wantlists">want lists</a> that state, for each item, which items they would like to receive in return.
<li> The moderator collects all the want lists into a file, and runs
TradeMaximizer (or other trade finding software) to find a valid set of trade cycles.

<li> The moderator publishes the trade cycles, and each participant
sends their item to the previous person in the trade.  (Usually,
trades will not be found for some of the items, in which case those
participants simply keep their items.)
</ul>

<p>
This style of trade was developed and popularized on <a
href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com">BoardGameGeek</a>, where they are
known as &ldquo;Math Trades&rdquo; and where the items being
traded are typically board games and card games.  However, the idea
can be used for any kinds of items.

<p>
TradeMaximizer improves on previous software for running such trades
in two ways:
<ol>
<li> TradeMaximizer is guaranteed to find the maximum possible number of trades.  (Previous
software usually found smaller numbers of trades.)
<li> TradeMaximizer runs very quickly, finding results in mere seconds
for trades involving over 1000 items.  (Previous software usually ran
for hours or days or longer.)
</ol>

<h2><a name="example"/>A Small Example</h2>

Here's an example of a very small trade involving six items.  The
moderator has decided to use the numbers 1-6 as the official item
names, and the participants have submitted the following <a href="#wantlists">want lists</a>:
<pre>
  (Alice) 1 : 3 2 6
  (Betty) 2 : 1 6 4 3
  (Craig) 3 : 6 2
  (David) 4 : 2
  (Ethan) 5 : 1 2 3 4 6
  (Fiona) 6 : 1 2
</pre>
The first want list states that user Alice is offering item 1 and wants one of items 3, 2, or 6 in return.  The other want lists read similarly.

<p>
The moderator runs TradeMaximizer, which finds the following five trades:
<pre>
  (ALICE) 1 receives (CRAIG) 3
  (CRAIG) 3 receives (FIONA) 6
  (FIONA) 6 receives (ALICE) 1

  (BETTY) 2 receives (DAVID) 4
  (DAVID) 4 receives (BETTY) 2
</pre>
Notice that Ethan's item 5 did not trade.

<h2><a name="running"/>Running TradeMaximizer</h2>

<p>
TradeMaximizer is designed to be run from the command line, rather
than using a graphical interface.

<p>
TradeMaximizer is run using the command
<pre>
    java -jar tm.jar &lt; <i>wantlistfile</i>
</pre>
For example, if the want lists are saved in a file
<tt>wants.txt</tt>, then you would say
<pre>
    java -jar tm.jar &lt; wants.txt
</pre>

<p>
By default, the results are printed to the console.  If you want to
save the results to a file instead, use the command
<pre>
    java -jar tm.jar &lt; <i>wantlistfile</i> &gt; <i>resultsfile</i>
</pre>
as in
<pre>
    java -jar tm.jar &lt; wants.txt &gt; results.txt
</pre>

<p>
For Windows users, there is a simple batch file that allows you to run
TradeMaximizer with the command
<pre>
    tm wants
</pre>
or
<pre>
    tm wants &gt; results.txt
</pre>
where the want lists are in the file <tt>wants.txt</tt>.

<h2><a name="wantlists">Want List Basics</h2>

<p>
Each want list is written on a single (possibly very long) line.
A typical want list is written as a list of item names separated by spaces,
with a colon after the first item.
<pre>
  <i>item0</i> : <i>item1</i> <i>item2</i> ... <i>itemN</i> 
</pre>
Such a list means that the owner of <tt><i>item0</i></tt> wants any
one of the items
<tt><i>item1</i></tt> through <tt><i>itemN</i></tt>.

<p>
Note that a want list can be empty, as in
<pre>
   123-OTHE :
</pre>
which means that the owner of <tt>123-OTH</tt> no longer wants to
trade the item.

<p>
Technically, the colon is optional (unless the moderator chooses the
REQUIRE-COLONS option), but it is a good idea to include the colon as
insurance against certain kinds of errors.

<p>
Individual item names are combinations of digits, letters, and dashes,
such as <tt>78</tt> or <tt>MANCALA</tt> or <tt>78-MANCALA</tt>.  By
default, TradeMaximizer is case insensitive, so <tt>MANCALA</tt>,
<tt>Mancala</tt>, and <tt>mancala</tt> would all refer to the same
item.

<p>
A username can be included at the beginning of the want list by
enclosing it in parentheses, as in
<pre>
  (John Doe) 123-OTHE : 078-MANC 456-CHES
</pre>
The username is optional (unless the moderator chooses the
REQUIRE-USERNAMES), but it makes the output more readable and
also protects against certain kinds of errors.

<h2><a name="priorities"/>Prioritizing Trades</h2>

<p>
By default, TradeMaximizer does not use priorities. The moderator can
choose to use priorities by specifying a priority scheme as an option
(eg, LINEAR-PRIORITIES).  Priorities allow a user to express a
preference for one item over another, even though both might be acceptable.

<p>
When using priorities, each wanted item in a want list is assigned a
certain cost, where lower cost means higher priority. The system then
uses cost as a tie-breaker among different ways of achieving the
maximum number of trades. In particular, it finds the set of trades
that has the minimum total cost, where total cost is the sum of the
costs of all the individual items traded.

<p>
All priority schemes begin by finding the rank of each wanted item in
a want list. The cost is then calculated as a function of rank.
<ul>
<li> In LINEAR-PRIORITIES, cost = rank. 
<li> In TRIANGLE-PRIORITIES, cost = 1+2+...+rank = rank*(rank+1)/2.
<li> In SQUARE-PRIORITIES, cost = rank*rank.
<li> In SCALED-PRIORITIES, cost = 1 + (rank-1)*2520/number of wants.
</ul>
In the simplest case, rank is equal to the position of the item in the
list. In other words, the first wanted item has rank 1, the second
wanted item has rank 2, and so on.

<p>
The simple case can be altered in two ways. First, the moderator can
set the SMALL-STEP=<i>num</i> option. This sets how much the rank increases
when you move from one position to the next. By default, the
small-step value is 1, and it shoud be rare to want any small-step
value except 1 or 0.

<p>
Second, the user can include a semicolon in a want list. A semicolon
says "increase the rank of the next item by the big-step value". (The
big-step value is 9 by default, but can be set by the moderator using
the BIG-STEP=<i>num</i> option.)

<p>
For example, in the want list
<pre>
  A : B C ; D
</pre>
item B has rank 1, item C has rank 2, and item D has rank 12, assuming
the small-step value is 1 and the big-step value is 9. Notice that the
gap in rank between items C and D is the small-step value plus the
big-step value, not just the big-step value. If the small-step and
big-step values were 0 and 100, respectively, then item B would still
have rank 1, but item C would also have rank 1 and item D would have rank 101.

<p>
Multiple semicolons in a row are allowed, as are semicolons before the
first wanted item.

<h2><a name="duplicates"/>Protection from Duplicate Items</h2>

<p>
It is common for more than one user to offer the same item for trade,
and it is also common for a single user to offer more than one item.
This raises the possibility of receiving more than one copy of an
item, when you really only wanted one.

<p>
For example, suppose you are involved in a trade of classic rock CDs,
and three people have offered Pink Floyd's <i>Dark Side of the
Moon</i>, which you would like to acquire.  If you have offered a
single item, say Traffic's <i>Low Spark of High Heeled Boys</i>, then
you can safely put all the copies of the Pink Floyd CD on your want
list, as in
<pre>
   123-LOW : 292-DARK 478-DARK 101-DARK 305-WHIT
</pre>
However, if you are also offering Cream's <i>Disraeli Gears</i>, then
you might not want to say
<pre>
   123-LOW  : 292-DARK 478-DARK 101-DARK 305-WHIT
   124-DISR : 292-DARK 478-DARK 101-DARK 305-WHIT
</pre>
because you could end up with two copies of <i>Dark Side of the
Moon</i>, perhaps receiving 292-DARK for 123-LOW and 101-DARK for
124-DISR.  It some situations, this would be okay, but in other
situations, you would vastly prefer not to get multiple copies of
equivalent items.

<p>
In TradeMaximizer, you can protect against getting duplicates by
using <i>dummy items</i>, as follows:

<ol>
<li> Add usernames to all of your want lists (if you haven't already).
<pre>
   (musicfiend) 123-LOW  : 292-DARK 478-DARK 101-DARK 305-WHIT
   (musicfiend) 124-DISR : 292-DARK 478-DARK 101-DARK 305-WHIT
</pre>

<li> Create a dummy item, named &ldquo;%something&rdquo;, and add the
set of duplicate items to the want list of the dummy item.
<pre>
   (musicfiend) %PINK : 292-DARK 478-DARK 101-DARK
</pre>

<li> Now remove the duplicate items from your regular want lists, and
add the dummy item instead.
<pre>
   (musicfiend) 123-LOW  : %PINK 305-WHIT
   (musicfiend) 124-DISR : %PINK 305-WHIT
</pre>
Now at most one of your regular items can &ldquo;win&rdquo; the dummy
item, and the dummy item can win at most one of the duplicate items,
so you will receive at most one of the duplicates.
</ol>

<p>
Some things to note about dummy items:
<ul>
<li> Dummy items can only be used if the trade moderator has selected the ALLOW-DUMMIES option. 
<li> You must include a username tag in any want list that involves dummy items. 
<li> You can create as many dummy items as you want. 
<li> You cannot refer to anyone else's dummy items, nor can they refer
to yours. (In fact, different users can have dummy items with the same
name, without confusion.)
<li> You can refer to one of your dummy items in the want list of another dummy item. 
<li> Dummy items are not included in the trade count, so they do not artificially inflate the number of trades. 
<li> In a trade with priorities, keep in mind that priorities are ignored in the want list for a dummy item. However, the priority of the dummy item in the want list for one of your regular items is handled normally. 
<li> Dummy items are elided from the trade output. For example, if
123-LOW received %PINK and %PINK received 292-DARK, then the output
would say that 123-LOW received 292-DARK. 
</ul>

<h2><a name="options"/>Controlling TradeMaximizer with Options</h2>

<p>
TradeMaximizer has numerous options that can be used to configure its
behavior.  Options are written inside the want list file itself,
rather than using command-line switches, so that other parties can
verify the trade using exactly the same options.

<p>
Options are written at the top of the file, on one or more lines
beginning with the characters &ldquo;#!&rdquo;.  (Note that lines
beginning with just &ldquo;#&rdquo; are comments.)  For example, the
following line declares two options, ALLOW-DUMMIES and REQUIRE-COLONS.
<pre>
  #! ALLOW-DUMMIES REQUIRE-COLONS
</pre>

<p>
Here are the options supported by TradeMaximizer:
<ul>
<li> <tt>LINEAR-PRIORITIES</tt>: Use the 1,2,3,4,... priority scheme. 
<li> <tt>TRIANGLE-PRIORITIES</tt>: Use the 1,3,6,10,... priority scheme. 
<li> <tt>SQUARE-PRIORITIES</tt>: Use the 1,4,9,16,... priority scheme. 
<li> <tt>SCALED-PRIORITIES</tt>: Use the scaled priority scheme, in which priorities are normalized into the range 1..2521.  If you are using this option, then you should also use <tt>BIG-STEP=0</tt>.
<li> <tt>SMALL-STEP=<i>num</i></tt>: Adjust how priorities change
between successive entries in a want list.  (The default value is 1.)
<li> <tt>BIG-STEP=<i>num</i></tt>: Adjust how priorities change for
each semicolon in a want list.  (The default value is 9.)

<p>
<li><tt>ALLOW-DUMMIES</tt>: Allow users to include dummy items to protect against getting duplicates.
<p>
<li> <tt>REQUIRE-COLONS</tt>: Make colons mandatory for every want list. 
<li> <tt>REQUIRE-USERNAMES</tt>: Make usernames mandatory for every
want list.
<p>
<li> <tt>ITERATIONS=<i>num</i></tt>: If set to a number larger than 1, then use randomization to find <i>num</i> different solutions, keeping the solution with the best sum-of-squares metric.  Note that all of the solutions will have the same number of trades and the same total cost.  (The default value is 1.)
<li> <tt>SEED=<i>num</i></tt>: Sets the seed for the random number generator to <i>num</i>, so that the results will be repeatable.  Only useful if <tt>ITERATIONS</tt> is set to a value greater than 1.
<p>
<li> <tt>HIDE-LOOPS</tt>: Do not output the trade loops. 
<li> <tt>HIDE-SUMMARY</tt>: Do not output the item summary. 
<li> <tt>HIDE-NONTRADES</tt>: Do not include items that did not trade in the item summary. 
<li> <tt>HIDE-ERRORS</tt>: Do not output error messages (except for fatal errors). 
<li> <tt>HIDE-REPEATS</tt>: Do not output error messages when a want list includes the same item more than once. 
<li> <tt>HIDE-STATS</tt>: Do not output the result statistics (other
than the number of trades). 
<p>
<li> <tt>SORT-BY-ITEM</tt>: Sort the item summary by item, instead of by username. 
<li> <tt>CASE-SENSITIVE</tt>: Treat item names as case-sensitive
instead of converting all lowercase letters to uppercase. 
<p>
<li> <tt>NONTRADE-COST=<i>num</i></tt>: Adjust the cost of not trading
an item from its default value of 1 billion to <tt><i>num</i></tt>. The net effect is
to forbid trade loops whose average cost per item exceeds <tt><i>num</i></tt>. Note
that this means that you can end up with less than the maximum number
of trades. 
</ul>

<h2><a name="officialnames"/>Official Names</h2>

A moderator can guard against several kinds of errors by including a
list of official item names at beginning of the want list file (after
any options, but before the first real want list).  Official names are
optional, but using official names protects against users
misspelling their own items (a surprisingly common occurrence!), and
also helps the system deal gracefully with missing want lists.  In
addition, official item names help users validate their own want lists
prior to submission.

Official items should be listed one per line, preceded by a line saying <tt>!BEGIN-OFFICIAL-NAMES</tt> and followed by a line saying <tt>!END-OFFICIAL-NAMES</tt>.  The whole file would then look like
<pre>
  #! <i>option</i> ... <i>option</i>

  !BEGIN-OFFICIAL-NAMES
  <i>item</i>
  ...
  <i>item</i>
  !END-OFFICIAL-NAMES

  <i>wantlist</i>
  ...
  <i>wantlist</i>
</pre>
When defining the official item names, the rest of the line after the
item name is ignored.  It is common for moderators to publish a list
of official item names, together with a brief description of each.
You can simply copy-and-paste this text in between the
<tt>!BEGIN-OFFICIAL-NAMES</tt> and <tt>!END-OFFICIAL-NAMES</tt> tags.  The only
requirement is that the description (if any) should be separated from the item name a space or a colon (or both), as in
<pre>
   123-LOW
   292-DARK Pink Floyd, Dark Side of the Moon
   305-WHIT: Beatles, The White Album
</pre>

Note that official names do not apply to dummy items.
